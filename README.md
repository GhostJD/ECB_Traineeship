# ECB_Traineeship
This accompanies my application for the traineeship in ECB's Forecasting and Policy Modelling Division.

Sorted according to relevance:

Files "2_transformations.R" (transforming raw data before they enter the model) and "6_excercise_baseline" (preparation of datasets for evaluation of out-of-sample performance) are small components of my ongoing ML GDP-nowcasting project at the CNB. This code shows my abilities the best. Unfortunately, it cannot be run, as some of the previous steps in the project use code done by my colleagues, which I do not want to share without their knowledge.

Focus.R is a code for figures present in the September volume of Global Economic Outlook published by the team I am part of. My article can be found here: https://www.cnb.cz/export/sites/cnb/en/monetary-policy/.galleries/geo/geo_2023/gev_2023_09_en.pdf (Chapter VI.).

Additionally, the files Project_France_Stage1.rmd, Project_France_Stage2.rmd, and Project_France_Stage3.rmd are assignments from a course I completed recently called Tools for Modern Macroeconomics.

Lastly, files Thesis_Code.R showcases the coding work I did for my Bachelor's thesis. Unfortunately, the code works with data collected by prof. Tomáš Havránek which I am unable to disclose.

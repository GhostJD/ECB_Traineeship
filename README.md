# ECB_Traineeship
This accompanies my application for the traineeship in Statistics and Data Science.

The files Thesis_Code.R and MPC.xlsx primarily showcase the coding work I did for my Bachelor's thesis.

Additionally, the files Project_France_Stage1.rmd, Project_France_Stage2.rmd, and Project_France_Stage3.rmd are assignments from a course I completed recently called Tools for Modern Macroeconomics.

Lastly, the file 2_transformations.R is a small component of my ongoing project at the CNB (sorry for the # captions in Czech) and Focus.R is a code for figures present in the September volume of Global Economic Outlook published by the team I am part of (Division of External Economic Relations). My article can be found here: https://www.cnb.cz/export/sites/cnb/en/monetary-policy/.galleries/geo/geo_2023/gev_2023_09_en.pdf (Chapter VI.).
